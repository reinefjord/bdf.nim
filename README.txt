This is a Nim library for parsing Glyph Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF) files
and rendering text using the font.

I make no guarantees about its correctness, functionality or readability. The
intended use is to to render monospaced fonts on small displays.
Writing Mode 1 isn't considered for example.

Read the code, use with care.
